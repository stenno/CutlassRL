<initd> can someone explain me how to implement angband-like speed system?

<rsaarelm> I don't know what that is.
<rsaarelm> But in general, you can make a flexible speed system like this: mobs have an energy value that's a number. Mobs get to act on an update frame if their energy is above zero. The action will decrease their energy by an amount that depends on the action, actions that take longer cost more energy. Mobs gain energy equal to their speed stat each update frame.
<rsaarelm> (Energy might not be the best term)
<ondras> "speed potential" maybe
<initd> hmm
<ondras> this system generally sounds pretty nice
<ondras> to start, make all your actions same energy-intensive
<rsaarelm> Yeah, that'll be equal to the one-turn-one-action thing.
<ondras> (but with actions properly sorted with respect to speed of all actors)
<initd> i'll try to implement this, thanks.
<rsaarelm> Jeff Lait opined on the ng why he doesn't like the squishy speed systems. Basically they make stuff like pillar-dancing unpredictable in an unfun way in his opinion.
<initd> also, player should have same speed system like monster?

<rsaarelm> Sure.
<initd> ok
<rsaarelm> Player *is* a monster, as far as engine is concerned, is what I'd go for unless there's reason to do otherwise.
